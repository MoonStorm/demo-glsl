demo-glsl
=========

Cloned from https://code.google.com/p/demo-glsl/ for further research.
The exec folder contains everything required for running the demo.
Solution updated to VS2013 plus fixed several compilation issues that surfaced due to this new dev environment.

== GLSL Demo, made in 2008 ==
=============================

SPACE:  switch camera mode (auto/free)
MOUSE:  control the camera view in free camera mode
ARROWS: move the camera in free camera mode
NUMPAD NUMBERS: teleport to a scene in free camera mode
	1 - island scene
	2 - shadow mapping scene
	3 - reflection/refraction scene
	4 - toon mapping scene
	5 - relief mapping and fur scene

+/-:   speed up/down the moving speed of the camera (and of the world)

A:     enable/disable anaglyph view
B:     enable/disable bloom post effect
V:     enable/disable vignette post effect
N:     enable/disable noise post effect
C:     enable/disable depth of field post effect
T:     show/hide camera splines

F2:    reload and recompile the shaders (lets you iterate faster if you want to play with the shader source code)

Have fun!
